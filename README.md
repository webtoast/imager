Imager
------

Electron app for image optimization on OS X.

* Drag and drop a folder of images onto the app window
* An `_OPTIMIZED` folder will be created in your folder
* Will process all nested folders but does not keep the folder structure when outputting files
* Does not currently work for dragging files, must be a folder.

**Notes**

* Requires `libpng` to be installed, `brew install libpng`, to optimize jpg files
* Boilerplate from [https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)
* Boilerplate stuff hasn't been updated
* This is just for testing, not meant to be used in a workflow for anything

Electron app for image optimization on OS X.

* Drag and drop folders and/or files onto the app window
* Files are saved into an `_OPTIMIZED` folder
* Will process all nested folders but does not keep the folder structure when outputting files

**Notes**

* Requires `libpng` to be installed, `brew install libpng`
* Boilerplate from [https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)
* Boilerplate stuff hasn't been updated
* This is just for testing, not meant to be used in a workflow for anything

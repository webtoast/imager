Imager
------

* Optimized images are saved into an `_OPTIMIZED` folder in the same parent folder as their source
* Optimizes all images in sub-folders but does not keep the folder structure when outputting to disk

**Notes**

* Requires `libpng` to be installed, `brew install libpng`
* Boilerplate from [https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate](https://github.com/szwacz/electron-boilerplate)
* This is just for testing, not meant to be used in a workflow for anything
